# Maximum Gap Minimization in Graphs

This is the Github-Repository belonging to my Bachelor's Thesis. It is not intended as a program for anyone to ever use.
It contains tests which won't work on other systems because of missing files (too large networks). 
You can see the algorithms from the thesis in the classes with suffix "Solver" and "eval"
